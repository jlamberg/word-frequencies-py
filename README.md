# Word Frequencies

python main.py <YOUR INPUT FILE HERE>
```

## Input

The file content is expected to be Unicode text, emojis, URLs, mentions, hashtags, and sequencies of emojis‚Äìbasically anything that you would see in chats and on social media.

To get a better idea, you can take a look at the [example input](data/example_input.txt).

familiar!üòç 1
This 1
sounds 1
this? 1
```
